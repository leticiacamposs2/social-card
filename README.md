Basically, Web Components need 4 specifications:

- Custom Elements: A set of Javascript APIs to define the components and their behaviors.
- Shadow DOM: A set of APIs to render the element into a dedicated and isolated DOM.
- HTML Templates: Allows you to use <template> and <slot> tags to define a portion of HTML to reuse in which slots could be filled with variable content.
- ES Modules: A specification to import and use Javascript Modules to create an agnostic modular approach.
